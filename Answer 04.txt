As per the provided formula -> Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) = accumulated revenue of a customer since
acquisition

(a) This graph doesn't provide adequate info to classify the performance as good or bad. Using only CLV as a primary KPI will be misleading as it doesn't incorporate customer acquisition cost.
(b) One possible update could be additional barplt of customer acquisition cost w.r.t the clv. Even better indicator will be plotting quotient between customer acquisition cost and clv value. Quotient>=3 is usually considered as good performance indicator.
